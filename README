Appraise Evaluation System
==========================

Initial import into GitHub on Oct 23, 2011.

## Overview

Appraise is an open-source tool for manual evaluation of Machine Translation output. Appraise allows to collect human judgments on translation output, implementing annotation tasks such as

  1. translation quality checking;
  2. ranking of translations;
  3. error classification;
  4. manual post-editing.

It features an extensible import/output format and can easily be adapted to new annotation tasks. The current version of Appraise also includes automatic computation of inter-annotator agreements allowing quick access to evaluation results.
